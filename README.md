# Introduction
The exposome refers to the totality of environmental, behavioral, and lifestyle exposures an individual experiences throughout oneâ€™s lifetime. Due to the modifiability of exposures, identifying the risk exposures on a disease is crucial for effective intervention and prevention of the disease. However, traditional analytical methods struggle to capture the complexities of exposome data: nonlinear effects, correlated exposures, and potential interplay with genetic effects. To address these challenges and accurately estimate exposure effects on complex diseases, we developed DeepEXPOKE, a deep learning framework integrating two types of knockoff features: statistical knockoffs (statKO) and polygenic risk score as knockoffs (PRSKO). DeepEXPOKE-statKO controls exposure correlation and DeepEXPOKE-PRSKO isolates genetic effects, while both can capture nonlinear effects. DeepEXPOKE is meant for UK BioBank data as of now, and will be adapted for additional data types and PRS scoring methods accordingly. The example .ipynb's do not need genetic data or PRS scoring scripts ran, but for any other data, users are asssumed to have their unique UKB feature data and chromosome .bed/.bim/.fam files downloaded to their cluster/local machines.

# 1) Install and test the DAG-DeepVASE package
1. Install and test Dr. Zhenjiang Fan's DAG-DeepVASE algorithm [here](https://github.com/ZhenjiangFan/DAG-deepVASE). 
2. Follow the instructions and set up DAG-DeepVASE on your local or remote computing platform. Some of the DAG-DeepVASE framework will be used as part of DeepEXPOKE.

# Important DAG-DeepVASE Package Requirements

:stars: rpy2\
:stars: keras (:bell: please use the version of 2.3.1, which can be installed using "pip install Keras==2.3.1".)\
:stars: Deeplift (:bell: please use the version of 0.5.1-theano, which should be downloaded online.)\
:stars: Tensorflow (:bell: please use the version of 2.2.0, which can be installed using "pip install tensorflow==2.2.0".)\

# 2) Install NEXTFLOW and pgsc_calc (Not necessary for running DeepEXPOKE example code)
1. Install and test Nextflow and pgsc_calc [here](https://pgsc-calc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
2. Follow the instructions and set up pgsc_calc for use on your local or remote computing platform.
3. Create your test samplesheet as per ``pgsc_calc`` documentation.
4. Run pgsc_calc via nextflow with this command (replacing the PRS with your desired trait IDs/score IDs):
``./nextflow run pgscatalog/pgsc_calc \
 -profile conda \
 --input ukb_prs_samplesheet_final.csv --target_build GRCh37 \
 --pgs_id PGSXXXXXX, PGSXXXXXX, (insert the actual IDs here instead of XXXXXX) \
 --min_overlap 0.75 \
 --run_ancestry ./pgsc_calc.tar.zst``


# 3) Run the following example .ipynb notebooks using Jupyter Lab/your preferred python IDE on the example data provided in the DeepEXPOKE repository in the following order:
1. ``Dataset_preprocessing.ipynb``
2. ``W_stats_all42-DeepEXPOKE.ipynb``
3. ``imbalanced+RF-DeepEXPOKE.ipynb``
4. Optional: Run ``final_LR+RF+XGB_featureselection.ipynb`` for feature selection comparisons.

The example PRS knockoffs file is in a .7zip format; please unzip it before using in the example notebook. 
Please refer to the ``featuremapping.csv`` file for interpretation of example causal results.
