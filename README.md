# Introduction
The exposome refers to the totality of environmental, behavioral, and lifestyle exposures an individual experiences throughout oneâ€™s lifetime. Due to the modifiability of exposures, identifying the risk exposures on a disease is crucial for effective intervention and prevention of the disease. However, traditional analytical methods struggle to capture the complexities of exposome data: nonlinear effects, correlated exposures, and potential interplay with genetic effects. To address these challenges and accurately estimate exposure effects on complex diseases, we developed DeepEXPOKE, a deep learning framework integrating two types of knockoff features: statistical knockoffs (statKO) and polygenic risk score as knockoffs (PRSKO). DeepEXPOKE-statKO controls exposure correlation and DeepEXPOKE-PRSKO isolates genetic effects, while both can capture nonlinear effects.
